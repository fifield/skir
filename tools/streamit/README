known issues
------------

- array sizes that variables (i.e. int sz = 10; int[sz] a;) are not allowed.
  for limited support like streamit has, we'd need a constant prop pass on the front end.

- portals not supported in any way

- paramaterized filters (i.e. the ones that look like c++ templates) not supported
