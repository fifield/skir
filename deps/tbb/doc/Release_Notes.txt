Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks - Release Notes
		  Version 3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------


System Requirements
-------------------

Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks (Intel(R) TBB) is available
commercially (see http://www.intel.com/software/products/threading) as a
binary distribution, and in open source, in both source and binary
forms (see http://threadingbuildingblocks.org).

When built from source, Intel(R) TBB is intended to be highly portable
and so supports a wide variety of operating systems and platforms (see
http://threadingbuildingblocks.org for more details).

Binary distributions, including commercial distributions, are validated
and officially supported for the hardware, software, operating systems
and compilers listed here.

Known Issues
------------

Please note the following with respect to this particular release of
Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks.

Library Issues

    - If an application uses static version of MSVCRT libraries or uses
	TBB DLL built with static MSVCRT (vc_mt variant), and throws
	an exception from a functor passed to task_group::run_and_wait(),
	the exception will not be intercepted by TBB and will not result
	in cancellation of the task_group. For a workaround, catch the
	exception in the functor and explicitly cancel the task_group.

    - If you are using Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks and OpenMP*
	constructs mixed together in rapid succession in the same
	program, and you are using Intel(R) compilers for your OpenMP*
	code, set KMP_BLOCKTIME to a small value (e.g., 20 milliseconds)
	to improve performance.  This setting can also be made within
	your OpenMP* code via the kmp_set_blocktime() library call.  See
	the Intel(R) compiler OpenMP* documentation for more details on
	KMP_BLOCKTIME and kmp_set_blocktime().

    - In general, non-debug ("release") builds of applications or
	examples should link against the non-debug versions of the
	Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks libraries, and debug builds
	should link against the debug versions of these libraries.  On
	Windows* systems, compile with /MD and use Intel(R) Threading
	Building Blocks release libraries, or compile with /MDd and use
	debug libraries; not doing so may cause run-time failures.  See
	the Tutorial in the product "doc" sub-directory for more details
	on debug vs. release libraries.
